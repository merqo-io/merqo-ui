# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- `pnpm test:coverage` no longer times out on slow Windows checkouts: the built-exports test gives its fresh Node process 120 s instead of 30 s.

## [0.32.1] - 2026-10-10

### Fixed

- Section title tooltips, and every other InfoTooltip left on the default `trigger="hover"`, now also open on tap, so phone and tablet users can read them. Hover and keyboard focus still open them; a second tap, a tap elsewhere or Escape closes them. `trigger="tap"` is unchanged.

### Added

- Allow StatTile callers to preserve label typography and container spacing.

- Allow compatible trigger, icon and content styling when composing InfoTooltip in touch interfaces.
