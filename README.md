# @merqo/ui

Shared structural/behavioral components for the Merqo kit family
(loopkit, merqo, paykit, qkit, stockkit). Ships **no color, font-family, or
radius values** — every component styles itself with shadcn's semantic
Tailwind classes only, so each kit's own `globals.css` token values
drive the rendered brand color automatically.

> Note: the full design rationale lives in an internal spec
> (`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-04-merqo-ui-structural-package-design.md`)
> in the Merqo Business workspace. It is not included in this repo and is
> not reachable from a standalone clone — this README is the
> source of truth for consumers of the package.

## Install

No npm registry — installed as a git dependency, pinned to a tag:

```json
"dependencies": {
  "@merqo/ui": "github:merqo-io/merqo-ui#v0.27.0"
}
```

### Required Tailwind setup

Tailwind v4's automatic source detection skips `node_modules` by design, so
it will **never** see this package's `bg-primary`, `text-muted-foreground`,
`flex-1`, etc. classes unless a consuming kit points it there explicitly.
Without this step, `@merqo/ui` components will render completely unstyled.

Add an `@source` directive to your kit's `globals.css`, alongside the
`@import "tailwindcss";` line, pointing at this package's built `dist/`
output:

```css
@import "tailwindcss";
@source "../../node_modules/@merqo/ui/dist";
```

Adjust the relative path to match where your `globals.css` actually lives
relative to `node_modules`.

`sheet.tsx`, `dropdown-menu.tsx`, and `tooltip.tsx` use `animate-in` /
`slide-in-from-*` / `fade-out-*` utility classes that **do not exist in
stock Tailwind v4** - they're shipped by the
[`tw-animate-css`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tw-animate-css) package.
Install it in the consuming kit and import it alongside Tailwind in
`globals.css`:

```css
@import "tailwindcss";
@import "tw-animate-css";
@source "../../node_modules/@merqo/ui/dist";
```

Without this, the Sheet/DropdownMenu/Tooltip open/close transitions silently
no-op (the classes just don't exist), which is easy to miss since nothing
errors - it just never animates.

### pnpm install-script allowlist

pnpm 11 blocks install scripts by default via an `allowBuilds` allowlist in
each consumer's `pnpm-workspace.yaml`. This package's `prepare` script runs
`pnpm build`, which is what produces `dist/` (gitignored, not committed to
this repo). If a consuming kit's `pnpm-workspace.yaml` doesn't allowlist
`@merqo/ui`, the build gets silently blocked, the kit installs an empty
package, and you get a confusing module-resolution error instead of an
obvious build failure. Add an `allowBuilds` entry for `@merqo/ui` and
verify the built `dist/` actually appears in `node_modules/@merqo/ui/` —
this check is part of the first kit's migration onto this package.

### `next/image` remote patterns (only if you use `ImageUploader`)

`ImageUploader` never imports `next/image` — the package has no `next`
dependency, so its preview falls back to a plain `<img>`. To get real
Next.js image optimisation, pass your own renderer:

```tsx
import Image from "next/image";
import { ImageUploader } from "@merqo/ui";

<ImageUploader
  bucket="vendor-images"
  pathPrefix={vendorId}
  value={url}
  onChange={setUrl}
  onUpload={uploadToStorage}
  imageComponent={Image}
/>;
```

If you do, your kit **must** allowlist the storage host in
`next.config.ts`, or `next/image` throws at runtime the first time a vendor
uploads a photo:

```ts
// next.config.ts
const nextConfig = {
  images: {
    remotePatterns: [
      {
        protocol: "https",
        hostname: "<project-ref>.supabase.co",
        pathname: "/storage/v1/object/public/**",
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

This is exactly the gap that made merqo's local copy render a raw `<img>`
behind an eslint-disable. A kit with its own wrapper (e.g. qkit's
`MediaImage`, which marks `.svg` sources `unoptimized`) passes that wrapper
as `imageComponent` instead.

### `driver.js` (only if you use `DashboardTour`)

`DashboardTour` handles `driver.js` and its base stylesheet internally —
both are imported lazily, at tour-start time, inside the component itself.
Consumers don't need to install, import, or configure either one
themselves.

The scoped popover styling (the part that actually differs per kit —
background, radius, button colors) is injected automatically at runtime
via your kit's own theme tokens (`var(--popover)`, `var(--primary)`,
etc.) — no separate stylesheet to manage for that part either.

`DashboardTour` never generates or imports tour step content — keep your
own `tour-steps.ts` exactly as it is today, and pass its array as the
`steps` prop. `steps` accepts either a plain array, or a lazy resolver
function (`() => TourStep[]`) for kits that need SSR-safe mobile-vs-desktop
splitting — the resolver is called only at tour-start time, matching how
the kits currently resolve `isMobile` via `window.matchMedia`.

### Private repo auth for CI / deploys

This repo is currently **private**. A local `pnpm install` works because it
reuses your local SSH/HTTPS git credentials, but that doesn't carry over to
GitHub Actions or Vercel — those need their own authenticated access (a
GitHub App install or a scoped PAT) to fetch a git-tag dependency against a
private repo. Set this up before wiring any kit's CI or deploy pipeline to
install `@merqo/ui`, or the install step will fail there even though it
works locally.

## Components

- `InfoTooltip` — icon + tooltip with a parameterized `aria-label` (defaults
  to `"More info"`). `trigger?: "hover" | "tap"` (default `"hover"`) switches
  to a click-triggered `Popover`, for touch-first flows where hover never
  fires.
- `useAsyncAction` — pending-state hook that always resets, even on throw.
  Ships a companion `navigatingAway(): Promise<never>` — `await` it at the
  end of a success-and-navigate branch to keep `pending` true through the
  route transition instead of the button re-enabling mid-navigation.
- `TwoColumnSections` — the profile/settings two-column flex-stack layout
  (never a CSS grid — see the component's test file for why).
- `Section` — visually-neutral field-group shell. `icon: ReactNode` (an
  already-rendered element, e.g. `<Store className="size-5" />`, not a
  component reference), optional `eyebrow?: string`, title, optional
  `description?: string`, optional `tooltip?: ReactNode` (rich content, not
  just a string). Kit-specific skins (e.g. a paper texture) layer on top via
  `className`, not baked into the component. Optional `wrapper?: (content:
ReactNode) => ReactNode` overrides the default `<section>` shell entirely
  (e.g. a kit's own bordered/textured card) — when set, `className` and the
  default bg-card/border/shadow classes don't apply.
- `FeedbackSheet` / `HelpSheet` — drawer-based feedback and support forms.
  `HelpSheet` supports a plain `mailto:` mode for kits with no
  ticket-queue infra yet, or a real form mode. `FeedbackSheet` takes an
  optional `showNps?: boolean` to add a 0-10 recommend-score grid above the
  message field (score becomes required, message becomes optional).
  `HelpSheet`'s form mode takes an optional
  `categories?: {value, label}[]` to add a category radiogroup above the
  message field (an empty array behaves like no categories at all). Both
  take optional `title?`/`description?` overrides (each kit's own copy) —
  omit either for this package's own defaults. Both pill grids share an
  internal `PillRadioGroup` implementing the full WAI-ARIA "radio group"
  keyboard pattern — only the checked pill (or the first, before anything's
  checked) is a Tab stop; Left/Right/Up/Down move focus and selection
  between pills, wrapping at the ends, and Home/End jump to the first/last
  pill.
- `AccountMenu` — the avatar dropdown alone (Profile, optional kit-local
  settings, optional Plan, Get help, Feedback, Sign out — always last,
  separated, destructive-styled). Reusable without the full nav shell. The
  trigger renders the cross-kit default avatar shape — a rounded-md ring
  avatar (image when `avatarUrl` is set, otherwise a 2-letter initials
  fallback) — no per-kit override needed. Takes an optional
  `extraLink?: {href, label}` for a kit-specific menu
  item, and forwards `showNps` to its internal `FeedbackSheet` and
  `getHelp.categories` (when `getHelp.type === "form"`) to its internal
  `HelpSheet`. `vendor.subtitle?: string` (e.g. the signed-in email) shows
  next to the trigger avatar and as a header line above Profile — omit it
  for no identity text anywhere, matching pre-`subtitle` behavior. Optional
  `tierBadge?: ReactNode` renders next to the vendor name in the dropdown
  header (only when `vendor.subtitle` is also set). The trigger always
  carries `data-tour="nav-account"` for `DashboardTour` step targeting.
  Optional `LinkComponent?: React.ComponentType<{href: string, ...}>` (since
  v0.10.0) renders Profile/Settings/Plan/help-submenu-items/`extraLink`
  through it instead of a plain `<a>` — pass `next/link`'s `Link` in a
  Next.js kit to avoid a full page reload on click, which can abort any
  in-flight fire-and-forget write (e.g. a "mark seen" call) started just
  before the click. Defaults to a plain `<a>` so the package stays
  framework-agnostic. The `mailto:` "Get help" item is always a plain
  `<a>` regardless — it never navigates the page, so there's nothing to fix.
  Since v0.18.0, a Light/Dark/System theme control (`next-themes`' own
  `useTheme`) sits above Sign out, replacing any kit-local theme toggle —
  the one home for theme switching across the whole kit family. Since
  v0.19.0 it's a `DropdownMenuSub` (trigger reads "Theme · {current}"),
  matching the "Switch products"/"Get help" submenu pattern, so the menu
  shows one row instead of three always-expanded options. Consuming apps
  must wrap their root layout in `next-themes`' own
  `<ThemeProvider attribute="class">` — without it, `useTheme()` still
  renders safely (no crash), but `setTheme` is a no-op and the control does
  nothing.
- `DashboardNav` — the full sticky-topbar shell (burger-left/avatar-right
  at every viewport). Composes `AccountMenu`, forwarding its own
  `LinkComponent` prop down to it. The burger always carries
  `data-tour="nav-menu"`. Optional `tourAnchor?: (href) => string` stamps
  `data-tour` on each nav link; optional `isActiveHref?: (href) => boolean`
  applies the cross-kit default active styling — a primary-tinted pill —
  and `aria-current="page"` — both injected, since this package has no
  router dependency of its own. The header's inner row is capped at
  `max-w-7xl`/centered (since v0.9.0) to match the content area every kit
  renders below it — a kit rendering wider content below the nav will look
  misaligned again unless its own `<main>` also caps at `max-w-7xl`.
  Optional `LinkComponent?: React.ComponentType<{href: string, ...}>` (since
  v0.10.0) renders each nav link (desktop and mobile) through it instead of
  a plain `<a>` — same rationale as `AccountMenu`'s prop above.
- `LandingNav` — public-page nav shell: sticky header, shared shape
  (`z-20`, `bg-background/85`, padding on the header not the inner `<nav>`),
  `max-w-6xl` centered row. Takes only two slots — `wordmark: ReactNode`
  and `end: ReactNode` — so each kit keeps full control of its own
  wordmark markup and right-side links/CTAs (copy and hrefs are legitimate
  per-kit content, not something this package should standardize).
- `ImageUploader` — square (`thumb`) or wide (`banner`) image upload control
  with JPEG/PNG/WebP validation, a size cap, an injected browser-side resize
  step, and an injected storage write (`onUpload`) so the package stays
  backend-agnostic. `uploading` always resets — success, validation failure,
  or throw. Default `variant` is `"thumb"` — qkit's booth-banner usage
  **must** pass `variant="banner"` explicitly when migrating, or it will
  silently render as a small square with the wrong resize target.
- `DashboardTour` — wires up `driver.js` (config, lifecycle, floating
  replay button, `driver.js` + its CSS both lazily self-imported) from an
  injected `steps` array/resolver, `onFirstSeen` callback, `isHomeRoute`,
  and `navigateHome` — the tour mechanism is shared, tour content, routing,
  and "has this user seen it" persistence stay entirely kit-local. The
  replay button renders on every page (not just the tour's home route);
  replaying from elsewhere navigates home first, then auto-runs once
  landed. `onFirstSeen` fires once, immediately when an unseen user's tour
  auto-starts — never on replay, never on completion. Ships the full
  cross-kit popover CSS ruleset by default (title, description,
  progress-text, close/prev/next buttons, 4-directional arrow tinting) — a
  migrated kit can delete its own `tour.css` entirely. Popover base class is
  the generic `"tour-popover"`, not kit-specific.
- `DashboardTours` — route-matched router for kits with more than one
  dashboard page tour. Takes `tours: {id, route, steps}[]`, the caller's
  current `pathname`, `seenTourIds: string[]`, and `onFirstSeen: (tourId) =>
Promise<void>`. Picks the tour whose `route` most specifically matches
  `pathname` (longest match wins, so a nested route like
  `/dashboard/booths/abc123` still resolves to the `/dashboard/booths` tour)
  and mounts only that one via `DashboardTour` internally — a page with no
  matching tour renders nothing at all, no floating button. Each mounted
  tour always sees its own route as home (there's never a cross-page replay
  to resume, since the active tour is already the one matching the current
  route), so `DashboardTour`'s single-tour `isHomeRoute`/`navigateHome`
  cross-page-replay mechanism stays available for kits that only need one
  tour but isn't exercised here. `DashboardTour` itself is unchanged and
  still exported directly for that single-tour case.
- `VendorTelegramSection` — vendor-facing Telegram connect settings block
  (Phase A2 of the cross-kit Telegram integration design), the shared
  replacement for each kit's own now-retired per-kit vendor-alert bot's
  settings UI. `connected: false` renders a "Connect Telegram" action that
  calls the injected `onConnect` (mints a fresh deep-link token on demand,
  e.g. via a server action — no token is pre-minted on page load) and then
  shows the returned `deepLink` + `qrSvgMarkup`; `connected: true` shows a
  connected status and a "Disconnect" action calling the injected
  `onDisconnect`. Optional `onError?: (error: unknown) => void` and
  `sectionWrapper?` (forwarded to its internal `Section`) match the rest of
  the package's own conventions. Named apart from any kit's own
  customer-facing Telegram-connect component — this one is vendor-scoped
  and standing, never single-use.
- `PlanComparisonTable` — the free/paid-tier feature-comparison grid shared
  across kits' `/dashboard/plan` pages. `tiers: {key, label}[]` (any
  length — column count is computed, never hardcoded to 2 or 3) and
  `rows: {label, values: Record<string, boolean | string>}[]` (`values`
  keyed by each tier's `key`). A boolean cell renders a check icon
  (`true`) or a muted dash (`false`); a string cell (e.g. `"1"`/`"∞"`)
  renders as plain centered text. The column grid uses a computed
  `gridTemplateColumns` inline style, not a Tailwind arbitrary-value
  class, so the layout can't be silently dropped by a consuming app's own
  JIT purge.
- `AuditLogTable` — renders a list of audit/activity entries
  (`{id, actor, action, target?, detail?, createdAt}`) as a bordered
  row list: action (with `detail` as a secondary line when present),
  actor, target (an em dash when omitted), and a right-aligned
  timestamp. `actor` is expected to already be a resolved display
  string (an email, a name) — this package has no auth/DB dependency,
  so resolving an `admin_id` to a human-readable actor is the caller's
  job, same as `ImageUploader`'s injected `onUpload`. Optional
  `formatAction?: (action: string) => string` maps a raw action string
  (e.g. `"set_vendor_plan"`) to a human label — omit it to render the
  raw string as-is. Optional `dateFormatter?: (date: Date) => string`
  overrides the default `Intl.DateTimeFormat` rendering. Optional
  `emptyState?: ReactNode` replaces the default "No activity recorded
  yet." message for a zero-row list.
- `StatTile` / `DeltaPill` — the label/value/delta content shared by every
  kit's stats strip. Deliberately ships with no outer card shell (border/
  background/padding/hover treatment) — three real kit implementations were
  compared and their outer wrapping diverged too much to unify; each caller
  wraps `StatTile` in its own container. `reverse?: boolean` swaps the
  default label-above-value order for value-above-label. `valueClassName?`/
  `captionClassName?` let a caller pick mono/display/plain instead of a
  fixed font. `delta?: number | null` renders the standard `DeltaPill`;
  `deltaSlot?: ReactNode` renders arbitrary content in the same slot instead
  (a breakdown-popover trigger, an icon) — mutually exclusive with `delta`.
  `valueTrailing?: ReactNode` renders content beside the value itself, for a
  richer indicator (e.g. a 3-state trend) that doesn't fit `DeltaPill`'s
  2-state up/down contract. `DeltaPill` itself takes `size?: "xs" | "sm"`
  and `downClassName?` since real kits don't share identical pill sizing or
  down-state color — only the up-state emerald is fixed across the family.
- `StatusBadge<T>({status, config})` — the dot + uppercase-tracked
  bordered-pill status chip shared across kits. `config: Record<T,
{label, className}>` is caller-supplied (same "caller supplies the map"
  contract `AuditLogTable`'s `formatAction` established), so each kit keeps
  its own status set and colors — only the rendering shape (dot, border,
  tint, tracking) is shared. Extracted from qkit's original implementation
  over printkit's/paykit's plain shadcn `Badge` uses, since qkit's was the
  one built on real semantic status tokens rather than raw Tailwind
  literals mixed in ad hoc.
- `DataTable<T>({rows, columns, getRowKey, emptyState?})` — the
  rows-of-columns table shell shared across kits' transaction/booking/job-
  history/vendor-list tables. Self-contained plain `<table>` + Tailwind
  (not a wrapper over each consumer's own shadcn `Table`), styled to match
  shadcn/ui's own `Table` primitives exactly, so it carries no cross-
  package import-path dependency — same reasoning as `AuditLogTable`.
  `columns: DataTableColumn<T>[]` (`{header, cell, className?}`) is
  caller-supplied, so this component owns only the table shell, never the
  domain columns. Deliberately not extended to kanban/card-grid list views
  (e.g. qkit's order board) — those are a genuinely different shape.
- `BackButton({href, label, LinkComponent?})` — the "leave this page" nav
  button (real `Button` hit target, not a plain text link) used at the top
  of every kit's setup/edit sub-pages. `LinkComponent` defaults to a plain
  `<a>`, same opt-in-router-Link contract as `DashboardNav`'s own prop.
  Promoted 2026-09-16 after being found byte-identical in 2 of 4 kits and
  near-identical in the other 2 (one kit's own copy literally commented
  "Mirrors qkit's identical component").
- `ElevatedCard({as?, className, children})` — the polished lifted-shadow
  card shell used across profile/dashboard/setup pages, deliberately not
  qkit's own scalloped `Ticket` theme (that stays local to qkit). `as`
  picks `div`/`section`/`li`. Promoted 2026-09-16, same "found
  byte-identical in half the kits" basis as `BackButton`.
- `SOCIAL_LINK_FIELDS` / `SocialLinks` (from `./social-icons`) — the
  vendor social-link field list (website/instagram/facebook/tiktok) with
  real brand marks and official colors (`@icons-pack/react-simple-icons`,
  `color="default"`); `website` gets a generic `lucide-react` globe tinted
  via `currentColor` instead. `SocialLinksFields({value, onChange,
idPrefix})` is the ready-made form-field group built on it (labeled
  inputs, `idPrefix` namespaces each field's `id` when a page renders more
  than one instance). Promoted 2026-09-16 — same field list and form was
  independently duplicated in all 4 kits.
- `MoneyInput({cents, onCommit, ...inputProps})` / `useMoneyField(cents,
onCommit)` — a controlled dollar-amount `<Input>`. Reformats to the
  canonical 2-decimal string only on blur (or on an external `cents`
  change while unfocused), not on every keystroke — reformatting live
  resets the caret to the end after each key, so typing "6.50"
  left-to-right would otherwise land as "6.01". `MoneyInput` wraps the hook
  as its own component so it's always called at a real component's top
  level, safe to render from inside a `.map()`. Promoted 2026-09-16 from
  qkit, the only kit that had it — loopkit's own dollar-amount field
  (`reward_cost_cents`) hand-rolled a plain `<Input>` with manual
  cents↔dollars conversion instead.
- `qrSvg(text)` (from `./qr`) — renders `text` as an inline SVG markup
  string via the `qrcode` package, for a caller to embed with
  `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` (a Telegram deep link, a shop-join QR).
  Promoted 2026-09-16 — merqo's own copy of this exact function already
  documented itself as "same shape/library as loopkit's ... own qrSvg
  helper"; this closes that gap instead of leaving a 3rd copy to drift.
  Unrelated to `react-qr-code` (qkit's booth-QR-poster, paykit's booking-QR
  view) — a heavier React-component wrapper for a different use case
  (rendering a full poster page vs. embedding inline SVG), not yet unified.
- `Footer({wordmark, tagline, kitName})` — the public-page footer shell:
  wordmark slot, tagline, "© 2026 {kitName} · a Merqo kit", About link,
  `LegalFooterLinks`, vendor sign-in link, in that fixed order. `wordmark`
  is an already-linked element (own href/anchor behavior — e.g. a
  same-page hash jump needs a native `<a>`, not a router `Link`), same
  slot contract as `LandingNav`'s own `wordmark` prop. The About/sign-in
  links render as plain `<a>` (not a `LinkComponent` prop) — a footer link
  is low-frequency enough that a full page load is an acceptable,
  deliberate simplification, matching the `LegalFooterLinks` it's
  composed with. Promoted 2026-09-16 after 3 of 4 kits' footers were found
  structurally identical (same layout order, differing only in
  wordmark/tagline/kit-name) — see the design-critique sweep's footer-
  parity work, which made them look identical without ever actually
  sharing the component.

`Footer` also takes two optional props for the two consumers whose footer
was otherwise identical: `showSignIn?: boolean` (default `true`) hides the
vendor sign-in link, for stockkit, which renders the same footer inside its
authenticated dashboard; and `copyright?: ReactNode` replaces the whole
copyright line, for merqo, which is the hub rather than a kit and so should
not say "a Merqo kit". `signInLabel?: ReactNode` (default
`"Vendor sign in →"`) overrides that link's copy, again for merqo, where
"Vendor sign in" reads oddly on the hub's own landing page.

- `BackToTop` — fixed bottom-right back-to-top button for a long landing
  page. Appears past ~600px of scroll, scrolls smoothly unless the visitor
  prefers reduced motion. Promoted 2026-09-19; was byte-identical in qkit,
  paykit, loopkit and merqo, and differed only in comments in stockkit.
- `GoogleMark` — Google's "G" mark for the Google OAuth button on every
  kit's login page. Promoted 2026-09-19; was identical in all five.
- `safeRedirectPath(next, fallback)` — open-redirect guard. Accepts only a
  same-origin relative path, rejecting `//`, `/\` and embedded control
  characters. Plain function, no React. Promoted 2026-09-19.
- `resizeToWebp(file, maxDim, quality?)` — client-side resize + WebP
  re-encode before upload, returning `{ blob, ext, type }` and falling back
  to the original file if the browser cannot decode or encode it. Where a
  browser cannot encode WebP it re-encodes as JPEG instead (v0.31.3): per
  the canvas spec an unsupported `toBlob` type silently yields a PNG, which
  earlier versions mislabelled as `image/webp` and which is several times
  larger than a JPEG of the same photo. `type`/`ext` always describe the
  bytes actually produced. Applies
  EXIF orientation so portrait phone photos are not sideways. Browser-only
  (Canvas). Promoted 2026-09-19. Each kit keeps its own upload adapter (the
  Storage bucket and path are kit-specific); only the resize step is shared.

- `storagePathFromPublicUrl(url, bucket)` — maps a Supabase Storage public
  URL back to its object path in `bucket`, so a caller can delete an image
  it is replacing. Returns `null` for anything that is not a public URL in
  that exact bucket, most importantly an OAuth provider's avatar (a Google
  profile picture lands in the same `avatar_url` field), which must never be
  treated as ours to delete. Plain function, no React. Added v0.31.4.

- `commitPendingImages(values)`, `isPendingImage(url)`,
  `PendingImageUploadError` — the save side of `ImageUploader`'s
  `deferUpload` mode. With `deferUpload`, picking an image resizes it and
  hands `onChange` a local `blob:` preview URL; nothing reaches storage.
  On submit, the form passes its image values to `commitPendingImages`,
  which uploads each pending one (to a fresh random path every call) and
  returns `{ urls, uploaded }`: the values in order with previews swapped
  for public URLs, plus the URLs it uploaded. Validate and save with
  `urls`; if the save fails, delete `uploaded` and keep the previews in
  state so a retry uploads again. If an upload itself fails it throws
  `PendingImageUploadError`, whose `uploaded` lists what did upload. Use
  `deferUpload` on every form with a Save button, so a vendor who picks an
  image and walks away leaves no orphan in storage; leave it off where
  picking is the save (profile icons). Added v0.32.0.

These are the first exports that are not React components. Since
v0.31.0 the package no longer applies a package-wide `"use client"` banner,
so a plain function like `safeRedirectPath` is a real value in a Server
Component rather than an opaque client-reference stub.

## Z-index scale

This package has no shared z-index token or constant — each component picks
its layer independently, following one implicit ladder. Documenting it here
so a consuming kit knows where its own page-level overlays should land
relative to these, without having to grep every component's className:

- **`z-10`** — `DashboardNav`'s mobile-menu tap-away scrim (the dimming
  backdrop behind the open mobile nav panel).
- **`z-20`** — sticky header shells: `DashboardNav`'s and `LandingNav`'s
  `<header>`, and `DashboardNav`'s mobile nav panel itself (which must sit
  above its own `z-10` scrim, and above normal page content scrolling
  beneath the sticky header).
- **`z-40`** — `DashboardTour`'s floating replay button (`fixed`,
  bottom-right on every page) — above normal content and the sticky nav,
  but below any modal-style overlay so a tour replay never traps focus
  above an open sheet/dropdown/popover.
- **`z-50`** — the transient overlay layer: `ui/dropdown-menu.tsx`,
  `ui/sheet.tsx`, `ui/popover.tsx`, `ui/tooltip.tsx`. These are the
  topmost layer in the package because they're all short-lived,
  user-triggered overlays that must never be occluded by anything else
  this package renders.

A kit adding its own overlay (a toast stack, a global modal, etc.) should
pick a value based on where in this ladder it belongs — e.g. above `z-50`
for something that must outrank an open Sheet/Popover, between `z-20` and
`z-40` for a page-level banner that shouldn't cover the tour's replay
button, etc.

## Audit trail standard

Not a shared library — each kit owns its own Supabase schema and writes its
own migration, same as everywhere else in the family (no cross-schema
queries, no shared server code). This section documents the _shape_ every
kit's audit trail should follow, the same way the Z-index scale above
documents a convention without shipping a shared constant. Written here
(2026-08-18) after a ground-truth check found the pattern already exists,
independently, in all four live kits (qkit, loopkit, paykit, stockkit) —
same table shape, copied kit-to-kit, but drifting in coverage. This section
exists so the next kit that adds or extends its audit trail copies the
same target, not whatever the most recently-read kit happened to do.

**Table shape** — one `admin_audit` table per kit's own schema:

```sql
create table <schema>.admin_audit (
  id         uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  admin_id   uuid not null references auth.users(id),
  action     text not null,
  target_id  uuid,
  detail     jsonb,
  created_at timestamptz not null default now()
);
create index admin_audit_created_idx on <schema>.admin_audit (created_at desc);
```

RLS: admins may `select`; no `insert`/`update`/`delete` policy for anyone —
writes only happen through the service-role client, same as the rest of
each kit's admin surface.

**Write path** — a small `recordAudit()` helper (paykit's
`src/app/admin/actions.ts` is the reference implementation) that inserts a
row and swallows its own failure: the action being recorded must never fail
_because_ logging it failed, but a logging failure should still surface in
server logs so a broken trail doesn't go unnoticed.

**Coverage** — log every mutating action a vendor or an admin could
plausibly need to reconstruct or dispute later (plan changes, pricing
changes, refunds, payment confirmations, cancellations, redemptions), not
only today's `/admin`-route actions. A cross-kit write initiated by merqo
on a vendor's behalf (e.g. a hub-triggered plan override) should also land
a row in the _target_ kit's own `admin_audit`, attributed to the merqo
system actor — never a silent service-role bypass.

**Domain ledgers count too** — a kit's own append-only domain data (e.g.
`loopkit.stamp_events`, `paykit.transactions`, `stockkit.stock_movements`)
already serves as a vendor-facing audit trail for that kit's core activity
and doesn't need to be duplicated into `admin_audit`. A kit whose core
mutable state has no such ledger (e.g. qkit's `orders.order_status`, a
single column overwritten on every transition, no history) should add one
before calling its own audit story complete.

**Immutability** — `admin_audit` and any domain ledger should be
append-only in practice, not just by convention: nothing today stops the
service-role client itself from editing or deleting a row. A kit relying on
its audit trail for a real dispute should add a DB-level guard (revoke
`update`/`delete` from the relevant role, or a rejecting trigger) rather
than assume application code alone won't touch it later.

**Retention** — state a retention window explicitly in the kit's own
`AGENTS.md` (5 years is the reference point — Singapore's IRAS record-
keeping norm for a small business) rather than growing the table forever
with no stated policy.

**Built (2026-08-19):** `AuditLogTable` (see Components below) — a
shared render component, same class as `PlanComparisonTable`/
`VendorTelegramSection` (renders rows uniformly, each kit passes its own
data, no backend coupling inside the package), so a vendor-facing
"Activity" view can look the same across kits without each one
hand-rolling its own table. A kit can adopt it today; nothing forces
that before its own `admin_audit` coverage above is real — the
component just renders whatever rows it's given.

## Usage

```tsx
import { InfoTooltip } from "@merqo/ui";

export function SettingLabel() {
  return (
    <div className="flex items-center gap-1.5">
      <span>API rate limit</span>
      <InfoTooltip
        content="Requests over this limit are queued, not rejected."
        ariaLabel="More about the API rate limit"
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm test
pnpm build
```
